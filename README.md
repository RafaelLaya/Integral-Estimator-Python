# Integral-Estimator-Python

This is a final project for an introductory to programming class under the quarterly system. The class is CS121 and it is taught in python. Under my profile there is another repository that has a Java integral estimator. I learned java in the break after summer quarter (when I took the CS121 class) and before fall quarter, therefore I would expect the java version to be more complete (because it was written a few weeks later than this one, it has more features, more mathematical functions, a better parser and is much better written in my opinion). The java version uses objects and is also (in general) much faster than this one (in most systems)!

The instructions to use the program are simple: Download the .py file and then run (make sure you have installed the latest version of python in your system. This is confirmed to run on python 3.5 and 3.6. The program itself has instructions on its own usage.

At all times the program assumes the function provided is of continous behaviour. If using the tolerance option then it is also assumed that the function is either always increasing or decreasing in the desired interval. Improper integrals are not supported.

This program uses the algorithms that students usually learn in a regular calculus II classroom.

You will need py_expression_eval to run this program. I used version 0.3.4

The source code was originally written using an online code editor called repl.it which is what we used for the CS121 class. At the moment of this writing this is exactly how the project was submitted (except for a memory issue that I just fixed). You can also run it online at repl.it
