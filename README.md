# Python Integral Estimator

This is a final project for an introductory to programming class under the quarterly system (summer 2018). The class is CS121 and it is taught in python. 

The instructions to use the program are simple: Download the .py file and then run. This is confirmed to run on python 3.5 and 3.6. The program will present an intuitive menu and it has instructions on its own usage.

This program uses the algorithms that students usually learn in a regular calculus II classroom.

# Dependencies
* You will need py_expression_eval to run this program. I used version 0.3.4
* The random and math Python libraries

# Examples
The following is a link to a youtube video of the integrator
