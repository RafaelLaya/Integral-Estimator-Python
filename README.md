# Integral-Estimator-Python

This is a final project for an introductory to programming class under the quarterly system (summer 2018). The class is CS121 and it is taught in python. 

The instructions to use the program are simple: Download the .py file and then run. This is confirmed to run on python 3.5 and 3.6. The program itself has instructions on its own usage.

This program uses the algorithms that students usually learn in a regular calculus II classroom.

You will need py_expression_eval to run this program. I used version 0.3.4

The source code was originally written using an online code editor called repl.it which is what we used for the CS121 class. 

Enjoy!

This work was submitted as a final project about 6 or 7 weeks of programming experience.
